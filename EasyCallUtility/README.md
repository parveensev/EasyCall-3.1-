#GPX Testing Files
When you need to test new countries and see the numbers you must use the simulator. You can simulate any location in the world using GPX Files. You can generate these files fairly easily [here](http://gpx-poi.com). Also make sure you place them under the "GPX files" group folder to keep things neat and rename the extension from gpx.txt to just .gpx thanks.
